#### To setup configuration without depending on build type.
Flow of **react-create-app** [GUIDE](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md) fully supported. To setup client side configuration simplify flow using non standard ```env``` **REACT_APP_ENV**. To run project localy with some specific configuration define configuration file for example ```.env```. Setup in to **REACT_APP_ENV**(environment variable) and run project.
